# JSBoxMatome

This project is some handy tools based on [JSBox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jsbox-make-your-own-tools/id1312014438). *Matome* in the title means summary in Japanese. Here it is a collection
*Hobo*(Means most in Japanese) by myself.

[netaddi](https://github.com/netaddi) helped me improved the README. Howerver, because the developer is lazy to update README, the content may be out-of-date.

## What included
Only my fav scripts introduced.

### yandereGetter2.js: A new version of the above

A crawler that explores and saves images from [yande.re](https://yande.re).

Renewed with matrix view. Supporting all 3 quailties. Saving & sharing. 

Error handling and settings are also included.

The legacy version is ```yandereGetter.js``` with place images in a list.

### 你打字带空格2.js: YOU TYPE WITH SPACING

Some text tools, targetting for efficiently made original string looks awesome, such as adding spaces between characters in a text(for emphasizing), reverse the text, and shuffle the characters in the text. Or make it a quote.

Supporting main App and keyboard.

The legacy version is ```你打字带空格.js```.

### 晚饭吃什么.js: What for dinner

Randomly select a dinner solution from a list of available dinner sources. 

###　Need improvement (TODO)

hex.js : More features.
