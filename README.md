# JSBoxMatome

This project is some handy tools based on [JSBox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jsbox-make-your-own-tools/id1312014438). *Matome* in the title means summary in Japanese. Here it is a collection
*Hobo*(Means most in Japanese) by myself.

[netaddi](https://github.com/netaddi) helped me improved the README. Howerver, because the developer is lazy to update README, the content may be out-of-date.

## What included
Sort by ABC, Pinyin(not all).

### hex.js: Number System Conversion

Convert numbers between decimal, hexadecimal, binary and more.

### yandereGetter.js: Image Crawler

A crawler that explores and saves images from [yande.re](https://yande.re).

### 你打字带空格.js: (YOU TYPE WITH SPACING) "Silly" Text Tools

Some text tools, targetting for efficiently made original string looks awesome, such as adding spaces between characters in a text(for emphasizing), reverse the text, and shuffle the characters in the text.

The "silly" in title is from a slang(with a bit offense) means playful or funny behavior in daily chatting in Chinese.(傻屌, or 沙雕 with similar pronunciation)

### 沙雕键盘.js: "Silly" Keyboard

Now JSBox can run script in keyboard, so I made this as enhanced edition of the above.

Need iOS11 to make "get selected text" work.

### 快速符号复制.js: Quick Clipboard for Symbols

Placed some often-used symbols which are difficult to directly type. Need to be updated to be keyboard extension.

### 晚饭吃什么.js: What for dinner

Randomly select a dinner solution from a list of available dinner sources. 

## How to use
1. Make sure you have an iPhone/iPad/iPod running iOS10.0 or higher and up-to-date [JSBox app](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/id1312014438) installed.
2. If you are using your computer (Windows PC, Mac, Linux and more), click the filename of a script and click `Raw` to get the file (or you can download all the files as a zip pacakge). Then use AirDrop or whatever else to drop the .js file to your iOS device, and open it with JSBox.
3. If you only have iOS device in your hand, click `View Code`, select all the code and copy them, then paste in JSBox.
